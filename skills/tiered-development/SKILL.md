description: Use when tackling a non-trivial feature, refactor, or design problem and you want the work delegated across model tiers instead of done inline — "design and build X", "plan then implement Y the tiered way", "delegate this properly". You (the Opus coordinator) draft a rough plan WITH the user via brainstorming, hand it to design-panel — a cheap Sonnet composer picks the Opus/Fable architect(s) by default, and you override only when the user asks — to refine into a waved plan, pause for the user's approval, then run each wave through the execute-wave workflow — fresh Opus builders for substantive steps, Sonnet for mechanical, Haiku for menial, each in its own git worktree — and close with a deep review (review-panel). NOT for trivial one-line edits (just do those) or whole-repo review (use full-project-review).

# Tiered Development

## Overview

Deliberate delegation so each model tier does what it is best at, with you (the
Opus coordinator) orchestrating and the user in the loop at the one gate that
matters.

- **Fable** (`tiered-development:architect`, `tiered-development:deep-reviewer`) —
  the strongest tier. It now **bills extra per use**, so spend it **sparingly** and by
  the right criterion: not "hard design decisions" but **complexity and impact** — the
  core of a hard algorithm, deep analysis of a large/existing codebase, hunting subtle
  long-standing bugs, or tracing the blast radius of a decision. Once Fable owns a
  panel aspect, integrate that panel with Fable too.
- **Opus** — three uses:
  - **You, the coordinator** — orchestration only: brainstorm with the user,
    route work, keep them in the loop, decide between tiers. Keep your own context
    lean; do NOT implement inline. Do NOT run builds/tests/lints or grep/read
    source files to check a worker's output either — the per-wave verifier
    verifies each step and the review-panel is the whole-change gate, so react to
    their structured verdicts instead of re-checking yourself. If you genuinely
    need to know something about the code, dispatch a `tiered-development:reader`
    rather than reading it directly; reading code or running checks inline burns
    your context and duplicates the workforce's job. The only commands you run are
    orchestration: probing `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree` for `isGit` and
    `git rev-parse HEAD` for a wave's `baseRef`, and the final integration
    commit/push.
  - **`tiered-development:builder` (Opus)** — the primary implementer, launched
    fresh per substantive step so each gets a clean, focused context.
  - **Default thinking tier** for `architect` / `deep-reviewer` and the **floor for
    the plan/verdict integrator** (never below Opus) — Fable's stand-in.
- **Sonnet** (`tiered-development:reader`, `tiered-development:implementer`,
  `tiered-development:verifier`) — the workforce: read-only research, mechanical
  edits, the per-wave integrator/verifier (which merges the wave's branches back,
  resolving conflicts in place, verifies, and squashes a green wave into one
  commit), and the mandatory **composer** (which groups the wave's steps into
  workers and tiers each).
- **Haiku** — the floor for genuinely menial work: `implementer` on menial steps
  and cheap `reader` lookups.

**Selection principle — how to pick a tier.** Pick the cheapest tier that will
reliably get it right, weighing the judgement the step needs against the cost of a
wrong result (subtle, hard-to-catch, wide blast radius). Menial, obvious-if-wrong
edit → Haiku. Routine mechanical work → Sonnet. Judgement, or an expensive silent
error → Opus. Fable only for high-complexity or high-impact work (deep bug-hunts in
existing code, blast-radius analysis), since it bills extra. Err upward when a
mistake would be costly. You *may* set tiers explicitly, or omit them and let a cheap
Sonnet composer decide.

**Why delegate instead of doing it yourself:** every implementation task goes to a
freshly-spawned agent with only the context that task needs. That focus — not the
coordinator juggling the whole job in one crowded context — is what raises code
quality. Your job is to slice the work cleanly and route each slice to the right
tier.

You drive this. The phases with real fan-out are extracted into small workflows
you **call** — `tiered-development:design-panel` (refine the plan),
`tiered-development:execute-wave` (build one wave), and
`tiered-development:review-panel` (final deep review) — because a script runs their
parallelism better than you can by hand. Always invoke them by these
fully-qualified names; the bare `design-panel` / `execute-wave` / `review-panel` do
not resolve. Everything else — the brainstorm, the approval gate, routing,
escalation — stays here, with you.

**Namespacing (required).** Every agent and workflow shipped by this plugin is
registered under the `tiered-development:` prefix. Whenever you dispatch one — as
a `subagent_type` for the `Agent` tool, or a `name` for `Workflow`/`Skill` — use
the fully-qualified name (`tiered-development:architect`,
`tiered-development:deep-reviewer`, `tiered-development:reader`,
`tiered-development:execute-wave`, …). The bare name is **not found** and the
dispatch fails.

## The protocol

### 1. Brainstorm a rough plan — WITH the user

Draft the approach and a rough set of steps *together with the user*. Use
`superpowers:brainstorming` to drive the dialogue, and dispatch
`tiered-development:reader` (Sonnet) agents to ground the discussion in what the code actually does before you commit
to an approach. The output of this phase is a **rough plan**: the chosen approach
plus a rough list of steps. It does not need to be dispatchable yet — the
architect(s) refine it next. Getting the user's intent right here is what the whole
pipeline depends on.

### 2. Refine the rough plan — via `tiered-development:design-panel`

Hand the rough plan to the architect(s) to turn into a concrete, dispatchable,
wave-grouped plan. **Call `EnterPlanMode` as/when you dispatch design-panel** —
dispatching the read-only design-panel workflow is planning work and is permitted
under plan mode, so entering it here makes the step-3 approval gate
harness-enforced (no edit can slip through before the user says go):

```
Workflow({ name: "tiered-development:design-panel", args: { level, task, roughPlan, panelModels, integratorModel } })
```

- `level` is `quick` | `standard` | `deep` — sets the plan's step budget. Scale it to the task.
- `task` is the task description; `roughPlan` is what you and the user drafted in step 1.
- **`panelModels`** (optional override) — a 1–5 array of `"opus"`/`"fable"`, one architect
  each: `["opus"]` a single Opus refine, `["opus","opus","opus"]` an Opus panel,
  `["fable","opus","fable"]` a mixed panel. On a multi-member panel the architects
  **divide the labour by aspect** (correctness, architecture, decomposition,
  verification, risk) — each owns one, with the whole plan for context — rather than
  each redundantly re-refining everything.
- **`integratorModel`** (optional, `"opus"`|`"fable"` — **never Sonnet**) — the model
  that merges the aspect-refined plans into the final one. **Defaults to the top tier
  present in the panel**, so a panel containing Fable integrates with Fable
  automatically (once Fable owns a hard aspect, an equal must merge it). The two-tier
  pattern — an Opus panel then a Fable integrator (`panelModels:["opus","opus","opus"],
  integratorModel:"fable"`) — puts Fable on the *final* design only.
- **Prefer omitting both** — a cheap Sonnet composer then picks the composition
  (Opus-leaning, Fable only for high complexity/impact). This is the default path;
  set them explicitly only when the user asks for a specific panel or integrator.

It returns `{ design, plan, waves, greenBar }` — `design` is `{ recommendation,
rationale, risks }`; `plan` is an array of steps, each `{ idx, title, files, change,
complexity, wave, verify, dependsOn }` (complexity ∈ `menial`|`mechanical`|
`substantive`; `dependsOn` is an array of prerequisite step `idx` values). Waves are
COMPLETE, GREEN, DELIVERABLE slices — green per the project's own rules, carried in
`greenBar` — and same-wave steps may be dependent and share files, with every
dependency made explicit in `dependsOn`. If `design.risks` carries a QUESTION about
the project's green bar (`greenBar` empty), resolve it with the user at the step-3
gate and supply the answer as `execute-wave`'s `greenBar`. If it returns a `BLOCKER`
instead (the rough plan was contradictory or its premise is wrong), resolve it with
the user before proceeding.

### 3. GATE — the user approves

Present the refined design (recommendation, rationale, risks) and the numbered,
waved plan to the user, then **call `ExitPlanMode`** — the user's response to it
*is* the approval gate. This honours the user's standing "plan before changes"
rule. `ExitPlanMode` must precede step 4, since `execute-wave` makes edits; do not
run a single wave until the user approves. This gate is the reason this skill exists
rather than an autonomous workflow — never skip it.

### 4. Execute — one wave at a time, via `tiered-development:execute-wave`

Probe once whether you are in a git repo (`git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree`,
directly or via a one-line `tiered-development:reader`). Then, for each wave in
ascending order, **re-probe `git rev-parse HEAD`** to get the current branch tip and
run:

```
Workflow({ name: "tiered-development:execute-wave", args: { task, wave, steps, isGit, totalSteps, baseRef, greenBar } })
```

- `steps` is just this wave's steps (filter the plan by `wave`). Each carries a
  three-tier `complexity` (`menial`→Haiku / `mechanical`→Sonnet / `substantive`→Opus).
  **Leave a step's `complexity` blank to let the composer pick its tier**; a
  *garbage* value is refused loudly (fix it), but absence just means "you decide".
  The mandatory Sonnet composer **owns dispatch**: it declares an ORDERED list of
  **batches** of **parallel jobs** — each job one worker doing one or more steps
  sequentially in one worktree; jobs in a batch run in parallel **even when they share
  a file** (the integrator reconciles), and batches run in sequence, each dispatched
  onto the prior batch's integrated tip. A step's `dependsOn` is **advisory** input the
  composer may override; an explicit `complexity` is still a **floor**, never downgraded.
- `isGit` is your first probe result; `totalSteps` is the whole plan's step count
  (for nicer labels).
- `baseRef` is the current `HEAD` sha you just probed. The harness cuts each worker's
  isolation worktree from the repo's **default branch**, not your checked-out branch,
  so the workers reset onto `baseRef` to build on the right foundation. **Re-probe it
  every wave** — the integrator/verifier advances your branch by **one squashed
  commit** each green wave, so passing the fresh tip is what carries the prior waves'
  results into the next one.
- `greenBar` is the project's green-bar command(s) from design-panel (or the user's
  gate answer); the wave's squash is gated on it.

The mandatory Sonnet composer owns dispatch: it declares an ordered list of
**batches** of **parallel jobs** — each job one worker doing one or more steps
sequentially **in its own git worktree** (substantive → Opus
`tiered-development:builder`, mechanical/menial → Sonnet/Haiku
`tiered-development:implementer`); jobs in a batch run in parallel, and each
batch is dispatched onto the prior batch's integrated tip. Then a **single** Sonnet
`tiered-development:verifier` merges the wave's branches back into your working tree
— resolving any conflict in place — checks all the wave's steps against the
integrated tree (one integrator/verifier, not one per step, so it also catches
interactions between them, and it diffs against the kept worktrees to pinpoint
merge-caused faults), and on a **green** wave squashes it into a **single summary
commit**, where green = every step passes AND the project's `greenBar` passes; a
failed wave keeps its per-step commits and worktrees for you to inspect. Worktrees
are used for **every** job in a git repo — even a single sequential
one — so the workers' in-progress, transiently-broken edits never reach your tree
and never flood your language server with false diagnostics. Outside git it falls
back to sequential edits in the shared tree.

`execute-wave` returns `{ wave, results, integration }`. **React between waves —
this is why you call it per wave rather than handing over the whole plan:**

- As you read each wave's `results`, **collect the builder/implementer flags** —
  the assumptions they had to make, local decisions, and explicit "coordinator
  should verify/confirm" notes from their `Report:` returns — not just the
  pass/fail verdicts. Carry them forward; they feed the final review (step 5).
- If a step returns a `BLOCKER` or a question, apply the **## Escalation rule** below.
- If the wave verifier returns `fail` or `needs-changes` on a step (it ran cleanly
  but the result is wrong — not a `BLOCKER`), do **not** advance the wave. Spin a
  targeted fix-up: re-dispatch that one step as its own single-step wave via
  `tiered-development:execute-wave`, escalating its tier (send it to
  `tiered-development:architect` if the fix needs a design decision), and re-verify
  before moving on.
- If `integration.conflict` is not `none` **or** `integration.failed` is set, stop
  and inspect. The integrator/verifier resolves conflicts in place, so a surfaced
  `conflict` is one it could **not** safely resolve — the wave's steps overlapped in
  a genuinely ambiguous way; re-plan that boundary. `failed` means it returned no
  result and could not confirm the merge (a crash, distinct from an ambiguous
  conflict) — inspect the tree before continuing. On a `fail`/`needs-changes` wave
  the worktrees are left in place on purpose, for you to inspect the original
  branches while spinning the fix-up. (`integration.resolved` lists files where a
  conflict *was* auto-resolved — the verifier scrutinises those, but they don't stop
  the wave.) On a green wave `integration.squashed` is set and `integration.summary`
  holds the one-line message of the single commit the wave was collapsed into. A
  multi-batch wave that aborts mid-batch leaves the earlier batches' integrated
  commits on your working branch un-squashed — `integration.conflict`/`failed` flags
  it; inspect before continuing.
- If a step you routed to Sonnet turns out to need judgement, re-route it to a
  `tiered-development:builder` rather than accepting a guessed result.

Only move to the next wave once the current one is integrated and clean, so the
next wave sees the settled result.

### 5. Final deep review

Once the whole change is assembled, run the cross-cutting review the per-wave
verifiers cannot (especially interactions between steps built in isolation), then
relay the verdict to the user. **Forward the builder/implementer flags you
collected in step 4** into the review's context — fold them into the
`review-panel` `changed` argument (or the inline `deep-reviewer` prompt) — so the
reviewer scrutinises exactly the spots the workers were uncertain about instead of
having to rediscover them. Two ways, scale to the change:

- **Deep / high-stakes** — `tiered-development:review-panel`, mirroring design-panel:

  ```
  Workflow({ name: "tiered-development:review-panel", args: { level, task, design, changed, files, reviewModels, integratorModel } })
  ```

  `reviewModels` (1–5 of `"opus"`/`"fable"`) fans out reviewers on distinct lenses;
  `integratorModel` (`"opus"`|`"fable"`, **never Sonnet**) merges them into one
  verdict (most severe wins). The two-tier pattern (`reviewModels:["opus","opus"],
  integratorModel:"fable"`) puts Fable on the *final* verdict only. Prefer omitting
  both — the Sonnet composer then picks; set them explicitly only when the user asks
  for a specific panel or integrator. Returns `{ review: { verdict, evidence, problems } }`.
- **Light** — a single `tiered-development:deep-reviewer` inline via the `Agent` tool
  (pick `model: opus`, or `fable` if it warrants the cost). No fan-out, no workflow.

**If the verdict is not `pass`, do not proceed to step 6.** If you are in doubt
about any finding — it may be a false positive, or rest on harness/project context
the reviewer lacked — surface the findings to the user and let them adjudicate which
to fix *before* dispatching any fix-up; do not autonomously loop back on uncertain
findings, since a review can be wrong and the user often holds context the reviewer
does not. Otherwise loop back: spin a targeted fix-up wave for the flagged steps
(via `tiered-development:execute-wave`, escalating tier as needed), or re-plan via
`tiered-development:design-panel` if the design itself is wrong — then re-review. If
you loop back by re-planning via design-panel (rather than just a fix-up wave),
re-enter plan mode after dispatching it and re-gate via `ExitPlanMode` before
executing the revised plan, exactly as in steps 2–3. Only a `pass` advances to
Integrate.

### 6. Integrate

Handle final integration (commit / PR) under the user's existing git-permission
prompts.

## Communication — keep it token-lean

Every agent you dispatch, and every `agent()` call inside the workflows,
follows `skills/tiered-development/comms-protocol.md`: returns are structured data,
not prose — terse, `path:line`-cited, verbatim on error strings / commands /
verdict keywords / `BLOCKER` / `QUESTION`, and never compressed where a
`BLOCKER`/`QUESTION` explanation or a security caveat needs to be unambiguous. When
you write a prompt for an agent, brief it the same way: say what you need back, not
a restatement of the task.

## Escalation rule

If a Sonnet or Haiku worker returns `BLOCKER`, ambiguous, or a question rather than
a result, resolve it yourself or escalate the step back to
`tiered-development:architect` (Opus, or Fable if it warrants the cost) for a design
decision. Never silently downgrade a judgement call to a cheaper tier by guessing on
the worker's behalf — that defeats the whole arrangement.

## Workspaces: why worktrees

`execute-wave` runs implementation workers in **isolated git worktrees**, not your
working tree, for two reasons:

- **A clean coordinator context.** Because edits happen in a separate checkout,
  your session's language server never sees the workers' in-progress, often
  transiently-broken edits — so you are **not flooded with LSP diagnostics** while
  work is underway. This holds even for a single sequential step, which is why
  worktrees are used whenever the repo is git, not only for parallel waves.
- **Parallelism.** Independent workers run concurrently; jobs in later batches are
  reset onto the integrated tip of the prior batch (`baseRef` still seeds batch 1).

One caveat the harness imposes: an isolation worktree is cut from the repo's
**default branch**, not your checked-out branch. That is why step 4 passes `baseRef`
(your current `HEAD`) into each wave — the workers `git reset --hard` onto it before
working, so a feature branch's foundation (and each prior wave's integrated result)
actually reaches them.

This needs a git repo. See `superpowers:using-git-worktrees` for the mechanics;
without git, `execute-wave` falls back to sequential edits in the shared tree.

## When NOT to use

- Trivial edits (a rename, a one-liner) — just do them inline; the tiering
  overhead is not worth it.
- Reviewing an entire existing codebase — use `full-project-review`.
- A change where the approach is already fully decided and needs no plan — skip
  the brainstorm/refine and go straight to dispatching workers
  (`tiered-development:builder` / `tiered-development:implementer`), still via
  `tiered-development:execute-wave` if you want the worktree isolation.
